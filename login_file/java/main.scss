This program uses a JComboBox to allow the user to select their user type (student, teacher, or admin), and then checks their username and password against the appropriate table in the MySQL database.

For the student and teacher logins, the program uses a PreparedStatement to prevent SQL injection attacks. For the admin login, the program simply checks the username and password against hardcoded values.

To save the student and teacher credentials as a .CSV file, you can use the following code:

```java
try {
    // Create the FileWriter and CSVWriter objects
    FileWriter fileWriter = new FileWriter("users.csv");
    CSVWriter csvWriter = new CSVWriter(fileWriter);

    // Write the header row
    String[] header = {"Username", "Password"};
    csvWriter.writeNext(header);

    // Write the student and teacher rows
    PreparedStatement stmt = conn.prepareStatement("SELECT * FROM students");
    ResultSet rs = stmt.executeQuery();
    while (rs.next()) {
        String username = rs.getString("username");
        String password = rs.getString("password");
        String[] row = {username, password};
        csvWriter.writeNext(row);
    }
    stmt = conn.prepareStatement("SELECT * FROM teachers");
    rs = stmt.executeQuery();
    while (rs.next()) {
        String username = rs.getString("username");
        String password = rs.getString("password");
        String[] row = {username, password};
        csvWriter.writeNext(row);
    }

    // Close the FileWriter and CSVWriter
    csvWriter.close();
    fileWriter.close();
} catch (Exception ex) {
    ex.printStackTrace();
}
